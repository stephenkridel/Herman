# Herman, an intuitive note taker for therapists

### Purpose

Through therapy practices, providers often need to write narative style notes chronicling their conversations with patients. Many emr-builders are not built for therapists, and others are either costly or out-dated. I am hoping to build a free and simple alternative based around the concept of a fully customizable tree structure that providers can traverse through to build their ideal note-builder.

### This app is built with:

- React
- Electron
- Redux Toolkit
