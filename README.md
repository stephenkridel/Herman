# Herman, an intuitive note taker for therapists

### Background

Many health practices use software systems called EMRs or electronic medical records. These include hospital charts that your physician records your past and current health. Many therapists also use EMR systems. More often they are used to record therapy notes that are taken after sessions with patients. These notes are often done in a narrative style and can be repetitive. EMR systems aren't usually built for therapists, or for their specific purposes. So they often have to write these narrative style notes from scratch which is a big time waste. There are EMR systems for therapists, but these are often paid products or outdated or both.

### Problem

Therapists have to write unique session notes after every session with patients. This is a time consuming and repetitive process.

### Solution

Develop software that allows therapists to record narrative style notes quicker and easier. Make the interface click through and fully customizable. This is Herman. Herman uses a very powerful system of blocks. Each block contains a title for reference and text that will be added to the note at a push of a button. Each block can also have child blocks. This system of parent and child blocks is what allows for customization and fluid flow of thought. Herman also has a neat variable system. Inside the text of a block, you can add in variables by using a simple bracket syntax. Just write "This is a text block with [one, two] variables." and then when you add the text, Herman will automatically prompt you to select a variable.

### This app is built with:
